= Internal Libraries

This directory hosts the internal libraries of *PolyLab*, which are composed of the regular structure of an Angular library, including the following:

- A `src` directory, containing the source code for the library.
- A `public_api.ts` file, which defines the public API of the library.
- A `tsconfig.lib.json` file, which provides a separate TypeScript configuration for building the library.
- A `package.json` file, which contains metadata about the library and its dependencies.
- A `README.md` file, which provides basic documentation for the library.
