    <h5>About</h5>
    <p>
      PrimeFlex is a part of PrimeVue, a popular UI component library for
      Vue.js, but it can also be used independently in any web project.
    </p>

    <p>
      With PrimeFlex, you can create responsive and dynamic layouts without the
      need for complex CSS calculations. It provides a simple and intuitive way
      to create grids and align elements within them.
    </p>

    <p>
      PrimeFlex offers a wide range of CSS classes that you can apply to your
      HTML elements to achieve the desired layout. These classes provide
      flexibility in adjusting column widths, setting responsive behavior, and
      controlling the appearance of elements on different screen sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The grid system in PrimeFlex uses a 12-column layout, allowing you to
      divide your content into equal or varying width columns. You can easily
      create responsive grids by combining different column sizes and applying
      appropriate responsive classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, PrimeFlex provides utility classes for margin and padding,
      allowing you to control the spacing between elements. You can also use
      classes to control the alignment of elements within grids, such as
      centering content vertically or horizontally.
    </p>

    <p>
      PrimeFlex is designed to be lightweight and efficient, enabling faster
      page loading and improved performance. It follows best practices for CSS
      and leverages the power of modern flexbox layout to simplify the process
      of building responsive web layouts.
